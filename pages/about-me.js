      <h1>About me</h1>
      <h3>Hello World!</h3>
      <h4>I&apos;m Parker!</h4>
      <h4>I&apos;m a software engineer, brother, philosopher, son, scientist, beer drinker,
        video game player, pet lover, and continuous learner.
      </h4>
      <p>
        I&apos;m probably a lot of other things too, but that&apos;s what came to mind initially.

      <p>
        Something Iâ€™ve always been passionate about is solving interesting, complex problems
        using innovation and creativity. While I was in University, this led me to study Philosophy
        and Neuroscience. I loved looking at abstract, complicated problems and working
        to design either empirical tests or abstract arguments to work to solve these problems.
        When I found software engineering, I found my true passion. For me, it&apos;s the perfect
        combination of problem solving, creativity, and innovation. I love facing down new
        complicated problems everyday. Additionally, I really enjoy working in the collaborative,
        innovative landscape of software engineering. There are always new tools and improvements
        being made and it makes engineering fresh and exciting.
      </p>

        Outside of software engineering, I still love to read and talk about both philosophy and
        neuroscience. I recently spent three years living and working in Japan.
        It was an amazing experience in which I grew and learned a ton everyday.
